        <p>As of right now, I believe my final project for this course will be in the Health IT realm.  I'd like to create an interface
        for patients and doctors to communicate securely and effectively about the patients' progress after surgery--for example.
        A simple tool that allows the doctor to crate a specific set of questions  for that patient to give a response within a specified time frame  or if unable to do so, a phone call will be initiated by someone on the patient care team.</p>

        <h1>Questions for the patient</h2>
            <ul>
                Has your dizziness or lightheadedness subsided?
                Have you followed the recommended meal guide?
                Are you sleeping through the night without any pain or discomfort?
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h1>List of possible answers</h1>
                <p><ul>
                        Dizziness has subsided.
                        There is still some dizziness.
                        Allergic reaction to tree nuts.
                        I'm following the suggested meals selectively choosing foods that agree with me.
                        I'm sleeping through the night.
                        I sleep through most of the night.
                        I'm getting very little sleep.
                        I'm sleeping through the night like a baby.
                </ul>

                <p>This interface will keep the lines of communication open until the patients' next visit and keep the doctor informed about the paitents' progress.  The doctor can make suggestions if further care is necessary or if the patient should come in to the outpatient facility for a closer look at their vitals. It will almost be as if the doctor is making a house call.</p>
